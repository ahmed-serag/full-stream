- adding login/register modal
- adding a dropdown with links to (user's wishlist/messages/request movie)

- on request a movie used should fill a form with movie name
- edit profile button where user can change his pic or his name
# required edits on movie page
- remove buy on amazon and buy on itunes buttons and replace them with like/dislike buttons
- remove pics under the player and replace them with a table of players similar to this one (http://full-stream.tv/7-minutes-streaming.html)
- add a button for each player to report if it's not running
- add a form for new comment under comments area
# required edits on series page
- the same for movie page + making each row of "Episodes" table clickable(it'd be great that on click on that row it calls a js function that makes an http req to get tha episode data and represent it in the page butthat's not required you don't have to build it, it's up to you)
